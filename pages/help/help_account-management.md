## Access the .gov registrar

You must have a [Login.gov account](https://login.gov/){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"} to request or manage domains in the new registrar. Login.gov provides a simple and secure process for signing in to many government services with one account. 

### If you had an account in the old .gov registrar {.h4}

If you had a .gov account prior to November 2023, you can’t use your old credentials to access the new registrar. You’ll need to [create a Login.gov account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external} with the same email address you used to sign in to the old registrar. That will ensure that you have access to your domains. 

If you need help finding the email address you used in the past, [contact us](../../contact/).

### How to create a Login.gov account {.h4}

[Go to Login.gov to create your account](https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"}. We recommend that you:

- Use your work email address to create your Login.gov account. Don’t use a shared inbox, team email, or distribution address.
- Add two authentication methods to your account. If you lose access to your primary authentication method (e.g. losing your phone), you’ll have a backup. You’ll be asked to set up authentication methods during the Login.gov account creation process.

### If you already have a Login.gov account {.h4}

We recommend adding your work email address to your existing Login.gov account and [sharing that address with the registrar](https://www.login.gov/help/manage-your-account/change-partner-email-address/){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"}. 

Login.gov will prompt you to verify your identity before you can request a .gov domain.

### Verify your identity with Login.gov (required for first-time domain requestors){.h4}

Before you can request your first .gov domain, we require you to verify your identity with Login.gov. This is a necessary layer of security that requires you to prove you are you, and not someone pretending to be you. You’ll need a state-issued ID, a Social Security number, and a phone number for identity verification. You’ll be prompted to verify your identity when you begin the domain request process. Read more about [verifying your identity with Login.gov](https://login.gov/help/verify-your-identity/how-to-verify-your-identity/){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"}.

Not all government services that use Login.gov require this type of verification, but you only need to do it once and it will apply to all government services that require it. 

### If you delete your Login.gov account {.h4}

If you don’t have access to your [Login.gov authentication methods](https://login.gov/help/get-started/authentication-methods/){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"}, you may be advised to [delete your Login.gov account](https://www.login.gov/help/manage-your-account/delete-your-account/){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"}. This will cause you to lose access to your domains. 

To regain access to your domains: 
1. Create a new Login.gov account.
2. Ask another manager on your domain to remove and re-add you in the .gov registrar. 

If you don’t have another domain manager, [contact us](../../contact/) to let us know you deleted your Login.gov account.  

## Change your password

Access to the .gov registrar is managed through Login.gov. You can [change your password at Login.gov](https://www.login.gov/help/manage-your-account/change-your-password/){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"}.

## Update your contact information

We [require](https://get.gov/domains/requirements/#what-gov-domain-registrants-must-do) that you maintain accurate contact information. The details you provide will only be used to support the administration of .gov and won’t be made public. 

### Name, role, or phone number {.h4}

To update your name, role, or phone number, visit your profile in the .gov registrar. 

1. Sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} using your Login.gov account.
2. Click the “Your profile” link in the header.
3. Update your name, role, or phone number.
4. Click “Save.”

Updating this information in your profile won’t affect your Login.gov account information.

### Email address {.h4}

To update your email address, visit your account on Login.gov. 

A Login.gov account may have [multiple email addresses](https://www.login.gov/help/manage-your-account/change-partner-email-address/){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"} associated with it, but your .gov profile only reflects the address you share with the registrar.

We recommend adding a work email address to your existing Login.gov account. However, you may want (or be required) to keep personal and work email addresses separate. In this case, we recommend creating a new Login.gov account that’s only connected to your work email address. 

#### Share a different email address that’s associated with your Login.gov account {.h5}

If the email address listed on your .gov profile is not the one you’d like to use: 

1. Navigate to your [Login.gov account](https://secure.login.gov/account/connected_accounts){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"} and verify that your desired email address is listed. If it’s not listed, add it.
2. [Change the email address shared](https://www.login.gov/help/manage-your-account/change-partner-email-address/#how-do-i-manage-which-email-gets-shared-with-any-partner-agency-i-have-connected-with){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"} with the registrar (“get.gov”) to the desired email address. 

#### Create a new Login.gov account using only your desired email address {.h5}

1. Create a new [Login.gov account](https://secure.login.gov/account/connected_accounts){.usa-link--external}{target="_blank"} and add your desired email address.
    - If this email address is associated with another Login.gov account, you’ll need to remove it from that account first.
2. Then, sign in to the [.gov registrar](https://manage.get.gov){target="_blank"} and verify your identity. Identity verification is required each time a new Login.gov account accesses the registrar.
